# Soft Serve

Google Maps app that enables communities to report and update known locations of their favorite ice cream trucks

## Features

- Custom marker icons
- Toast notifications for errors and setting markers
- Gets user's geolocation and shows ice cream within a reasonable walking radius and a radius a bit further away for those willing to walk more
- Display route to truck location of choice
- Supports searching for any location using Reach ComboBox and Places Autocomplete
- Ability to set a new marker (ice cream location) on the map for other users to see
- Supports deleting markers for trucks that are no longer there
- Pre-loaded with markers for demo 

## Note 

- InfoWindow component is slightly bugged (renders twice), so I used InfoWindowF as suggested by a comment on react-google-maps support
